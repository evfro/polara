    "The main goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how one can use Polara to conduct custom experiments with very specific requirements. Needless to say, it can be useful for reproducing someone's research as well. Below you'll find a particular example based on one of my favorite papers called *\"[EIGENREC: generalizing PureSVD for effective and efﬁcient top-N recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06033)\"*, which helped me to see standard SVD-based models in a differrent light and even led me to [my own discoveries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10634). Even though it's not necessary for understanding the material below, I strongly recommend to read the original paper as it builds on top of clear ideas and contains a very thorough analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key take home message from this paper for me personally is that **SVD can be viewed as a particular case of a more general eigendecomposition problem of the scaled similarity matrix**. Based on that insight, the authors of the *EigenRec* model propose several modifications, which involve tuning the scaling factor as well as the similarity measure in order to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">In this tutorial we are not going to reproduce the full work and will focus only on some of its easy-to-implement parts. Basically, we will alter only the scaling factor to see how it affects the quality of recommendations.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the tutorial allows to verify validity of the proposed ideas and creates a convenient playground for further exploration."

It is also useful to see how Polara can be customized to serve specific needs. The key ingredient here is the control of the type of entities that are recommended. By default, Polara expects items to be recommended to users and looks for the corresponding fields in the test data. These fields are defined via `data_model.fields.userid` and `data_model.fields.itemid` attributes respectively. The default behavior, however, can be redefined at the model level be setting `model._prediction_key` (users by default) and `model._prediction_target` (items by default) attributes to custom values. This scheme, for example, can be utilized in cold start experiments, where the task is to find users potentially interested in a \"cold\" item instead of recommending items to users (see `polara.recommender.coldstart` for implementation details). The following lines show how to change the default settings for our needs:"

Of course, there are slight differences; however, there are many factors that may affect it, like data sampling and unrated items randomization. It would be a good idea to repeat the experiment with different `seed` values and draw a confidence region around the curve. However, there are no drammatic differences in the general behavior of the curves, which is a very nice result that didn't take too much efforts. Here are some top-score configurations from the experiment:"

    "Clearly, the values are capped on the left half of the graph, which leaves the room for further improvement. I have performed experiments with a higher threshold and was able to achieve a higher top score with a bit lower value of the scaling parameter. If you want to see this, simply rerun the grid search experiment with a higher value of the `max_rank` variable. Be prepared that it will take a longer time (hint: reduce the search space for the scaling parameter). Anyway, the key conclusion doesn't change - **even a simple scaling factor can be advantageous and allows to outperform the standard model**. This conclusion is supported by many other experiments in the original paper, which we haven't run here."

    "Being a researcher myself, I'm often involved in some sort of \"redoing\" the work that was already done by someone else. Leaving the reproducibility aspect aside, there are many other reasons why it can be useful, e.g., it may help to understand presented ideas better or to see if there're any subtle moments in an original work that are not evident at first glance. It helps to create a playground ready for further exploration and may even lead to new ideas. I hope that Polara will help you with this as it helps me in my own research."
